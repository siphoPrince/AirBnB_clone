# AirBnB Clone Command Inte

Welcome to the AirBnB Clone Command Interpreter project! This project is the first step in building the AirBnB clone, a web application that will encompass various components like HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, and front-end integration. The primary goal of this project is to develop a command interpreter that will manage AirBnB objects and serve as the foundation for the subsequent stages of development.

## Description of the Command Interpreter

The command interpreter is a crucial component of the AirBnB clone project. It enables users to interact with the application by providing commands to create, update, delete, and display various objects, such as users, states, cities, places, and more. The command interpreter acts as a bridge between the user and the underlying objects, allowing users to perform various actions without directly manipulating the objects themselves.

## How to Start

To start using the AirBnB Clone Command Interpreter, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Odarell35/Airbnb-clone.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd airbnb-clone
   ```

3. Install any necessary dependencies. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

## How to Use

Once you have the project set up, you can use the command interpreter by following these steps:

1. Launch the command interpreter by running the following command:
   ```
   python console.py
   ```

2. You will be presented with a prompt where you can enter various commands to manage AirBnB objects.

3. Use commands like `create`, `show`, `update`, `destroy`, and `all` to interact with the objects. Refer to the examples section below for more details.

## Examples

- Create a new user:
  ```
  (hbnb) create User
  ```

- Show details of a specific object:
  ```
  (hbnb) show User 12345
  ```

- Update an object's attributes:
  ```
  (hbnb) update User 12345 first_name "John"
  ```

- Delete an object:
  ```
  (hbnb) destroy User 12345
  ```

- Display all objects of a specific type:
  ```
  (hbnb) all User
  ```
